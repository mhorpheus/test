## [20210805] - initial release
A **first official release** of the DFIR documentation developed under IR Standarisation initiative. Released documents do not cover full scope of DFIR activities, and further work is necessary to complete it. It contains a lot of changes in the workflows covered by released pages and for this reason it is not feasible to list all changes. All XFIR consultants should thoroughly read all released pages.

Following documents are published as complete:
- Digital Evidence Handling
- Engagement Close-out
- GDPR
- Global Hotline
- IR Spin-Up process
- Pager Duty for Global Hotline
- Resilient Ticketing
- Threat Intel
- Triage and Scoping Call


Following documents are published as partial release, thus not yet fully covering discussed topic:
- EDR
- Project Management
Future updates will add necessary content.

Also, all legacy content, which has not been unified or discussed and approved cross geo, has been moved to a "legacy documents" folder within github section.
