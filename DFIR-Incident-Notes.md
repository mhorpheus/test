## Purpose
Forensic and Incident Response engagements can have a lot of lot of moving pieces and maintaining detailed notes with date/timestamps can greatly assist with running an engagement and recapping what occurred and when while writing reports. 

The current Incident Notes document is available in the Incident Response [Templates](https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/53676630277) Box instance. 

The Incident Notes document is used to keep track of the following types of data/information:

 - Relevant information provided to or by the client
 - Meeting notes/minutes
 - XFIR and client requests and the corresponding timestamps
	 - **Note**: The ETS has the "To-Dos & Action Items" tab to officially track XFIR/Client requests and actions. 
 - High value events or findings
 - Recording identified recommendations
