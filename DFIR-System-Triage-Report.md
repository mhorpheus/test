## Overview
The XFIR System Triage Report is an intermediary reporting document between an System Timeline and a full Forensic Report. Triage Reports are useful in large-scale incidents where documenting and communicating findings in a more report-like manner is required or if a client does not wish to have a full Forensic Report created. 

The current XFIR System Triage Report template and an example Triage Report are available in the Incident Response [Templates](https://ibm.ent.box.com/folder/53676630277) Box instance. 

The XFIR System Triage Report should be completed in a manner that is consistent with the [XFIR Documentation & Reporting Style Guide](https://github.ibm.com/XFIR/DFIR-wiki/wiki/XFIR-Documentation-and-Reporting-Style-Guide) and on-par with the quality of a final XFIR deliverable, just containing less detail. 

## Sections
The current XFIR Triage Document contains four (4) sections:

 - Executive Summary
 - System Details
 - Background/Initial Lead
 - Summary of Findings

### Executive Summary
