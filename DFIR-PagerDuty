# PagerDuty

### Pager Duty
Pager Duty is an application that facilitates the management of on-call rotations. If you have not already set up your Pager Duty account profile you can sign into Pager Duty using your `w3id` credentials. You will want to update your profile with the appropriate phone number that will be used when Hotline calls are escalated to you. 

 - Update your Pager Duty profile
 - Check and be aware of your upcoming on-call rotations
 - Work with your manager and your regional Pager Duty admin to make changes within the schedule:

| Region | Pager-Duty Admin | Alternate |
|--|--|--|
| North America (NA)| Fred Chidsey (fachidse@us.ibm.com) | Phil Harrold (rpharrol@us.ibm.com) |
| Asia-Pacific (APAC) | Amanda Nelson (anelson@au1.ibm.com) | Stephen Burmester (sburmester@au1.ibm.com) |
| Europe, Middle East, & Africa (EMEA) | Adam Smutnicki (adam.smutnicki@pl.ibm.com) | Adam Harrison (adam.mj.harrison@ibm.com)|

*Note: If Primary does not answer an incoming hotline call, Pager Duty will route that call directly to the Secondary on-call member. If neither answers the call, the client will get a voice recording and it is the responsibility of the on-call personnel to return that call.* 

There will always be two people on-call at any given time, a `Primary` and a `Secondary`. The primary individual is responsible as the main IRIS hotline point of contact during their on-call shift and should work directly with their secondary or "backup" on-call personnel to cover any period(s) of time that the `Primary` will not be able to take an in-coming Hotline call.


If the hotline call does not reach any of the on-call IRIS consultants, the caller will be presented with an option to leave Voice Mail. In such a case it's on-call person responsibility to attempt to reach out to the caller and perform “Initial call” discussion.
