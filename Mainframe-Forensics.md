## Introduction
The purpose of this page is to provided guidance for handling Mainframe Forensics requests. This is is a living document. If there is something you want to see documented here or explained with further detail please contact your geographic Functional IR Lead (listed on the  [Homepage](Home)).

This page was build based on recommendations received from IBM Mainframe specialists. 

## Guidelines
Below guidelines pertain to z/OS based Mainframe. Due to specifics of Mainframe, XFIR would not be able to perform forensics investigation on such environment and requires dedicated Mainframe specialists assistance. Additionally, based on the past engagements of Mainframe team, it is highly unlikely that DFIR (in our terms) investigation is needed, when Client is asking for "forensics investigation". This is also related to the fact, that it's quite easy to pull security logs from Mainframe and review them, and for this reason, clients often can do it themselves. What most probably they would be asking for is a some kind of security configuration audit/review to check whether security related functions are properly configured for future cases. 

When you receive a request mentioning mainframe forensics, follow below steps
1. Speak with a Client and try to determine what exactly is expected: is it reactive review of potentially malicious activity or rather proactive check/audit of security configuration/controls?
2. If request still sounds like a reactive investigation, ask Client to extract "Security Audit Records" so we can provided them to our Mainframe specialists.
3. Reach out to Marc Van der Meer1 (NL, marc_vd_meer@nl.ibm.com) for assistance on such a request.

Marc would be able to assist with both reactive and proactive requests pertaining mainframe security.
