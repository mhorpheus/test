## Introduction
The purpose of this page is to document the XFIR Incident Response Service Spin-Up process and procedures. This is is a living document. If there is something you want to see documented here or explained with further detail please contact your geography Functional IR Lead (listed on the  [Homepage](Home.md)).

## Remote Evidence Collection Manuals
Digital Evidence collection can be performed on-site and remotely. Especially for remote IR engagements, digital evidence collection is not performed by XFIR consultants, but by personnel who may have very little, if not zero, knowledge in this area. For this reason, a set of so called "Evidence collection one-pager instructions" has been prepared. Such instruction can be shared with anyone performing collection and guides such person in simple steps through whole process. Instructions address all necessary topics such as data confidentiality, remote delivery challenges, etc. 

XFIR one-pagers deal with most common topics related to evidence collection, such as:
- dead box imaging,
- Windows:
	- RAM capture,
	- live imaging,
- Linux:
	- RAM capture,
	- live imaging,
- VMs imagining/exporting,
- triage data collection,
- data disposition,
- HDD encryption detection.

Always share only the PDF version of the one-pager with a Client. All manuals are available for a download [here](documents/evidence%20collection%20one%20pagers).



## Delivery
- physical delivery of the piece of the evidence or it's image,
- spin-up address how to build env for delivery

## Introduction
The purpose of this page is to document the Chain of Custody for digital evidence. This is is a living document. If there is something you want to see documented here or explained with further detail please contact your geography Functional IR Lead (listed on the  [Homepage](Home.md)).

**Chain of custody** (CoC), in legal contexts, is the chronological documentation or [paper trail](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paper_trail "wiktionary:paper trail") that records the sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of physical or electronic [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence "Evidence"). The CoC requires that from the moment the exhibit is collected, every transfer of an exhibit from person to person be documented **and** that it be defensible that nobody else could have accessed that evidence. It is best to keep the number of transfers as low and minimal as possible. In the courtroom, if the defendant questions the CoC, the documentation completed to date will prove that whatever evidence is being used, was the evidence collected during the incident. It is utterly vital that *any* chain of custody paperwork be completed diligently, and then checked by a second XFIR Analyst. If the chain of custody is broken, the Accused and their Legal Counsel will ask the court to exclude the exhibit as there is plausible deniability and the evidence may have been tampered with.

## XFIR CoC Templates
XFIR maintains Chain of Custody documents for:
* [Single Item](documents/IBM%20X-Force%20IR%20Chain%20of%20Custody%20-%20Single%20Item.docx)
* [Multiple Items](documents/IBM%20X-Force%20IR%20Chain%20of%20Custody%20-%20Mulitple%20Items.docx)


## CoC Example
An example of  _chain of custody_  would be the recovery of an exhibit during the course of XFIR responding to an incident:

1.  An XFIR Analyst would collect the exhibit, or capture information during an incident. The exhibit would then be either catalogued, transferred to another Analyst, or both.
2.  The analyst would then log the exhibit into the evidence management system, and store the exhibit securely. The XFIR Analyst would then render the exhibit to an Exhibit Clerk.
3.  The Exhibit Clerk would store the exhibit until it is needed, documenting everyone who has accessed the original copy and/or exhibit.
