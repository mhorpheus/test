# Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) Service Wiki

Welcome to the Digital Forensics & Incident Response service Wiki. This page aims to document the XFIR DFIR service and covers what you need to know to deliver the service from hotline call to final deliverable. 

Digital Forensics & Incident Response as a service is at the core of what we do here at XFIR. Much of our service posturing is designed around helping clients be better prepared for an incident. However, no client is the same and while preparation is key to helping clients get ready for a security incident; eventually they will face one and require our help. It is our duty to our clients and to XFIR to prepare ourselves and deliver these services as professionals to the best of our ability.

The documentation outlined here is intended to be a set of guidelines for XFIR consultants delivering DFIR services and is a living document. If there is something you want to see documented here or explained with further detail please contact one of the regional Wiki managers:
