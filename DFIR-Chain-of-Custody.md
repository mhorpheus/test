## Chain of Custody

**Chain of custody** (CoC), in legal contexts, is the chronological documentation or [paper trail](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paper_trail "wiktionary:paper trail") that records the sequence of custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of physical or electronic [evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence "Evidence").

IRIS maintains Chain of Custody documents for:
* [Single Item](https://github.ibm.com/IRIS-NA/DFIR-wiki/blob/master/DFIR/IBM%20X-Force%20IRIS%20Chain%20of%20Custody%20-%20Single%20Item.docx)
* [Multiple Items](https://github.ibm.com/IRIS-NA/DFIR-wiki/blob/master/DFIR/IBM%20X-Force%20IRIS%20Chain%20of%20Custody%20-%20Mulitple%20Items.docx)


### CoC Example
An example of  _chain of custody_  would be the recovery of an exhibit during the course of IRIS responding to an incident:

1.  An IRIS Analyst would collect the exhibit, or capture information during an incident. The exhibit would then be either cataloged, transferred to another Analyst, or both.
2.  The analyst would then log the exhibit into the evidence management system, and store the exhibit securely. The IRIS Analyst would then render the exhibit to an Exhibit Clerk.
3.  The Exhibit Clerk would store the exhibit until it is needed, documenting everyone who has accessed the original copy and/or exhibit. 

The Chain of Custody requires that from the moment the exhibit is collected, every transfer of an exhibit from person to person be documented **and** that it be defensible that nobody else could have accessed that evidence. It is best to keep the number of transfers as low and minimal as possible.

In the courtroom, if the defendant questions the chain of custody, the documentation completed to date will prove that whatever evidence is being used, was the evidence collected during the incident.

_It is utterly vital that *any* chain of custody paperwork be completed diligently, and then checked by a second IRIS Analyst._ 

*This step is mandatory and vital*

If the chain of custody is broken, the Accused and their Legal Counsel will ask the court to exclude the exhibit as there is plausible deniability and the evidence may have been tampered with.
