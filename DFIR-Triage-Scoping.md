# IRIS Global Triage/Scoping Call Procedures

The purpose of this page is to document the IRIS Triage and Scoping call procedures.

As a result from an in-bound hotline call or other means in order to properly scope the requirements and gauge expectations from the client during an incident engagement, a proper scoping call should be conducted to facilitate better understanding of the incident and what type of IR engagement and effort are necessary. Typically the Triage and/or Scoping call is the next logical step from the initial hotline call. As a guideline, the Triage/Scoping call should be scheduled as soon as possible following the initial hotline call.

The following documentation is a guideline for IRIS consultants for IRIS Triage and Scoping call procedures and is a living document. If there is something you want to see documented here or explained with further detail please contact your geography Functional IR Lead (listed on the [Homepage](https://github.ibm.com/IRIS-NA/DFIR-wiki/blob/master/Home.md)).

## Triage and Scoping Procedures
The Triage call typically follows an initial hotline call regarding some type of potential security incident. It is highly recommended to have the IRIS member who answered the initial Hotline call on the Triage/Scoping call for continuity. In addition to the IRIS Hotline duty member a Lead/Manager or senior member of the team is required to properly scope the engagement. 

### General Triage and Scoping Guidelines

 - IRIS should have the following members on the call at minimum:
	 - IRIS Hotline personnel who took the call (`Primary` or `Secondary`)
	 - A Team-Lead or Manager 
	 - Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) 

To provide the best service and continuity with the client, the IRIS member who answered the initial Hotline call should be present on the Triage/Scoping call. We need to provide our clients and potential customers with an end-to-end experience and it starts with how we communicate.

To best help the client with their requests, a Team-Lead, Manager, or senior member of the team should be present on the call to help answer questions about our services and how they can be used. Additionally, having a senior member of the team available is important for properly scoping the incident and mapping that to our availability.

Depending on the situation, one or more SMEs could be required for the call to provide guidance and requests for additional information. Work with your team using the `iris-hotline-ic` Slack channel to identify the required SMEs and their availability for your Triage/Scoping call.

In general try to keep the Triage/Scoping call staffed with minimum required IRIS team members needed as to not overwhelm the client or tie up too many resources from the IRIS side. 

 - Required outputs from Triage/Scoping calls:
	 - Update Resilient Triage Worksheet
	 - Update Resilient Notes
	 - Did the client engage IRIS?
		- **Yes**	>> Begin the ***IR Spin-Up Process***
		- **No**	>> Follow the [Resilient Ticketing Procedures](https://github.ibm.com/IRIS-NA/DFIR-wiki/wiki/IRIS-Resilient) for closing the ticket
	- Client Follow up
	
During the Triage/Scoping call, the IRIS team participating should identify someone to take detailed notes. It is also highly recommended to fill out the Resilient Hotline Triage Worksheet during the call while the details are fresh. If the client is engaging IRIS for incident response services, an IRIS member can begin the ***IR Spin-Up Process***. 

Regardless of the engagement status, at the conclusion of the Triage/Scoping call the Resilient ticket needs to be updated with the relevant engagement information, or the Hotline Triage Ticket should be closed. Please see the [Resilient Ticketing Procedures](https://github.ibm.com/IRIS-NA/DFIR-wiki/wiki/IRIS-Resilient) for more information.

### Conducting Triage and Scoping Calls
While conducting the Triage/Scoping call keep in mind the client's point of view. They could be experiencing their worst day and tensions could be high. It is important to get the facts and as much detail as possible. Identify someone to run the call and someone to take notes. It is also good practice to fill out the Triage Worksheet on the Resilient ticket during the call. 

Some things to consider:

 - What actions has the client taken within their environment or with the affected systems thus far?
 - Has the client properly secured the data required for analysis?
 - Does the client need onsite support?
 - What are the goals of the engagement?
 - Is the client Ad-hoc? Will the work require the client to sign a Statement of Work (SOW)?
 - Will the engagement require a Project Change Request (PCR) for additional hours?
 - Who will be the client POCs for the engagement?
 - It is recommended to establish a regular cadence for status updates

Take all of the relevant information and provide options for next steps. If the goals of the engagement are well defined and agreed upon, inform the client that IRIS will follow up in an email with a summary of the engagement goals and the agreed upon next steps. This will give the IRIS team involved time to properly estimate the number of hours required and the availability of resources. 

## Post Triage and Scoping Procedures
Following the Triage/Scoping call, there are some follow up activities that should be handled as soon as possible. If the client decided not to engage us, the Resilient ticket, Triage worksheet, and Notes should be filled out and the Hotline Triage ticket should be closed. The notes should include as much detail as possible about the client and the incident in the case that they decided to call us back or engage us at a later time. Please see the [Resilient Ticketing Procedures](https://github.ibm.com/IRIS-NA/DFIR-wiki/wiki/IRIS-Resilient) for more information on closing tickets.

If the client has decided to engage IRIS for incident response services, it is the responsibility of the Team-Lead/Manager who was present on the Triage/Scoping call to work with other Leads/Managers  properly estimate the required number of hours IRIS will need to support the engagement. As well as identifying the available IRIS members who can support the engagement regionally as well as globally if needed.

Once the resources have been aligned and the estimated hours are determined, the IRIS team member who ran the Triage/Scoping call will follow up with the client and provide the following:

 - Summary of the Triage/Scoping call
 - Engagement goals as defined during the Triage/Scoping call
 - Next steps including tasks that are take-aways from the Triage/Scoping call
 - Estimate of initial hours required to support the IR engagement
	 - If the client has a retainer request approval from a designated `Incident Declarer`
	 - If the client is AdHoc request written agreement to the scope and estimate

*Note: If the client is AdHoc work with leadership to get the Statement of Work (SOW) process initiated once the client has agreed to the estimated hours.*

Once the client has agreed in writing (usually via email reply), the Engagement Lead or other IRIS stakeholder can begin the ***IR Spin-Up Process***. Once IRIS has staffed the engagement the `Owner/Manager` and `Engagement Leads/Members` can be edited to reflect the assigned resources.
